# Building the Whitelist Contract

## Step 1: Set Up Your Development Environment

You'll need Node.js and npm installed on your machine. You'll also need to install the Hardhat development environment by running `npm install --save-dev hardhat`.

## Step 2: Create a New Hardhat Project

Run `npx hardhat` in your terminal and select "Create an empty hardhat.config.js" to create a new Hardhat project.

## Step 3: Install Dependencies

You'll need to install the ethers.js library, which is a library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain. You can install it by running `npm install --save ethers`.

## Step 4: Write the Smart Contract

Create a new file in the `contracts` directory of your project and name it `Whitelist.sol`. Write your smart contract in this file. The contract should have functions to add and remove addresses from the whitelist, check if an address is on the whitelist, and a modifier to restrict certain functions to only addresses on the whitelist.

## Step 5: Compile the Smart Contract

Run `npx hardhat compile` in your terminal to compile your smart contract. This will check your contract for any errors and create an ABI for it.

## Step 6: Write a Deployment Script

Create a new file in the `scripts` directory of your project and name it `deploy.js`. In this file, write a script that deploys your smart contract to the Ethereum network.

## Step 7: Deploy the Smart Contract

Run `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js` in your terminal to deploy your smart contract. Make sure to note down the contract's address.

## Step 8: Write a Test File

Create a new file in the `test` directory of your project and name it `whitelist-test.js`. In this file, write tests for your smart contract.

## Step 9: Test the Smart Contract

Run `npx hardhat test` in your terminal to run your tests.

## Step 10: Interact with the Smart Contract

You can interact with your deployed contract by using the ethers.js library in your dApp. You'll need to create a new instance of the contract using the contract's address and ABI.

Remember to replace the placeholder contract address and private key with your actual contract address and private key.
