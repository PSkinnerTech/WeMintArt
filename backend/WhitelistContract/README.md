# Whitelist Smart Contract

This project involves building and deploying a whitelist smart contract. The contract allows the owner to add Ethereum addresses to a whitelist, and only whitelisted addresses are allowed to perform certain operations.

The contract is built using Solidity and deployed using the Hardhat development environment.

## Steps to Build the Whitelist Contract

1. ~~Install Node.js and npm.~~
2. ~~Install Hardhat using npm: `npm install --save-dev hardhat`.~~
3. ~~Create a new Hardhat project: `npx hardhat`.~~
4. ~~Install ethers.js: `npm install --save ethers`.~~
5. ~~Create a new Solidity file for the contract in the `contracts` directory.~~
6. ~~Write the contract code.~~
7. ~~Compile the contract: `npx hardhat compile`.~~
8. ~~Write a deployment script in the `scripts` directory.~~
9. ~~Start a local Hardhat network: `npx hardhat node`.~~
10. ~~Deploy the contract to the local Hardhat network: `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network localhost`.~~
11. ~~Note down the contract address output by the deployment script.~~

The contract address for the deployed whitelist contract is: `0x5fbdb2315678afecb367f032d93f642f64180aa3`.

## Steps to Connect the Contract to the Frontend

1. Install ethers.js in the frontend project: `npm install --save ethers`.
2. Create a new instance of ethers' Contract object with the contract's address and ABI.
