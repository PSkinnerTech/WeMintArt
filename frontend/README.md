# WeMintArt Frontend

This project is the frontend for the WeMintArt application. It is built using React and connects to a Whitelist Contract deployed on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as a typical React application, with the main entry point being `src/index.tsx`. The `src` directory contains all the React components, services, and utilities used in the application.

## Connecting to the Whitelist Contract

To connect the frontend to the Whitelist Contract, follow these steps:

1. ~~**Install Dependencies**: Make sure all the necessary dependencies are installed by running `npm install`.~~

2. ~~**Update Contract Address**: In the `src/contract.ts` file, replace the placeholder contract address with the actual address of the deployed Whitelist Contract.~~

3. ~~**Connect Wallet**: The application uses [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) for wallet management. Make sure you have MetaMask installed and set up in your browser.~~

4. ~~**Start the Application**: Start the application by running `npm start`. The application should now be connected to the Whitelist Contract and ready for use.~~

5. ~~**Add Whitelist Functionality**: Implemented the functionality to add an address to the whitelist.~~

6. ~~**Check Whitelist Functionality**: Implemented the functionality to check if an address is on the whitelist.~~
=======
5. ~~**Add Wallet Address to Whitelist**: The application now includes a form for adding a wallet address to the whitelist. Enter the address and click "Join Whitelist" to add the address.~~

6. ~~**Check Whitelist Status**: The application now includes a button for checking the whitelist status of an address. Click "Check Whitelist" to fetch and display the list of whitelisted addresses.~~

7. ~~**Update Favicon**: Updated the favicon to a custom image.~~

8. ~~**Update Main Image**: Replaced the default image with a custom image.~~

## Next Steps

The next steps for this project would be to implement the functionality for removing addresses from the whitelist, as well as handling errors and edge cases for the whitelist functionality.
