# WeMintArt

The WeMintArt project is a decentralized application (dApp) that allows users to mint and manage Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs).

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main parts:

### Frontend

The frontend of the dApp is built with Next.js and Chakra UI. It provides a user-friendly interface for users to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.

Users can mint NFTs, view their minted NFTs, and manage their NFTs directly from the dApp. The frontend is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, even for users who are new to blockchain and NFTs.

### Whitelist Smart Contract

The Whitelist smart contract is written in Solidity and deployed on the Ethereum network. It manages a whitelist of addresses that are allowed to mint NFTs during the presale stage.

The contract includes functions for adding and removing addresses from the whitelist, and checking if an address is on the whitelist. This allows the project team to control who can mint NFTs during the presale stage, ensuring a fair and transparent process.

## How It Works

When a user visits the dApp, they can connect their Ethereum wallet and mint NFTs. If the user's address is on the whitelist, they can mint NFTs during the presale stage.

Once an NFT is minted, it appears in the user's collection in the dApp. The user can view their NFTs, and if they decide to, claim them. Claimed NFTs are marked as such in the smart contract and can no longer be claimed again.

## Future Plans

We plan to continue developing and improving the WeMintArt project. Future updates may include additional features, improved user interface, and more.

Stay tuned for more exciting developments!
